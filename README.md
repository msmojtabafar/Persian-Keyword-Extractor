# Persian Keyword Extractor üìù‚ú®

A simple and efficient web application built with **Flask** for extracting keywords from Persian texts.  
This project supports two popular keyword extraction methods: **TF-IDF** and **RAKE**.

---

## Features üöÄ
- Extract keywords from one or multiple Persian texts  
- Choose between TF-IDF and RAKE algorithms  
- Display both overall corpus keywords and keywords for each individual text  
- Clean, user-friendly web interface with full RTL support for Persian language  
- Customize the number of keywords to extract

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### 1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)  
This method calculates the importance of each word based on its frequency in a document and its rarity across the entire corpus.

### 2. RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)  
RAKE extracts candidate keyword phrases by analyzing word co-occurrences and stopwords in the text.

The key steps are:  
- Split the text into candidate phrases based on stopwords  
- Calculate the **degree** of each word as the total number of co-occurrences with other words  
- Calculate the **frequency** of each word in the candidate phrases  
- Compute the score of each word:  
\[
score(w) = \frac{degree(w)}{frequency(w)}
\]  
- Assign each candidate phrase a score equal to the sum of scores of its words
